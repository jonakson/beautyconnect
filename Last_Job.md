Perfect! I have successfully initialized the complete BeautyConnect monorepo project structure based on the CLAUDE.md specifications. Here's a summary of what was created:

  ðŸŽ‰ Complete Project Structure Initialized

  Root Level Files:

  - âœ… package.json - Workspace configuration with npm workspaces
  - âœ… .gitignore - Comprehensive ignore patterns for Node.js/TypeScript/Docker
  - âœ… .env.example - Complete environment variable template
  - âœ… README.md - Project documentation with setup instructions

  Shared Module (/shared/):

  - âœ… Package configuration - package.json, tsconfig.json
  - âœ… Types directory - API, models, auth, and booking types with examples from CLAUDE.md
  - âœ… Constants directory - API endpoints, business rules, and time constants
  - âœ… Utils directory - Date, validation, and formatting utilities
  - âœ… Main exports - Central index.ts with all exports

  Frontend Module (/frontend/):

  - âœ… Next.js 14+ setup - package.json, tsconfig.json, next.config.js
  - âœ… App Router structure - Route groups for (auth), (dashboard), (public)
  - âœ… Component directories - ui/, calendar/, booking/, dashboard/
  - âœ… Library setup - API client with shared types integration
  - âœ… Basic pages - Homepage with pricing tiers, login page, layouts
  - âœ… Tailwind CSS - Complete styling setup with custom utilities

  Backend Module (/backend/):

  - âœ… Express.js setup - package.json, tsconfig.json, server.js
  - âœ… Prisma schema - Complete database model matching CLAUDE.md specifications
  - âœ… Directory structure - routes/, controllers/, services/, middleware/, lib/
  - âœ… Basic server - Health endpoints, CORS, security, WebSocket setup
  - âœ… Shared types integration - Proper import paths configured

  Docker Configuration:

  - âœ… Individual Dockerfiles - Multi-stage builds for frontend and backend
  - âœ… Docker Compose - Base configuration with all 4 services
  - âœ… Development overrides - Hot reloading with volume mounts
  - âœ… Production config - Resource limits and optimization settings

  ðŸ”§ Key Features Implemented:

  1. Type Safety Across Full Stack - Shared TypeScript types prevent API drift
  2. Microservices Architecture - Separate containers for each service
  3. Hot Reloading - Development setup with volume mounts for shared code
  4. Production Ready - Multi-stage Docker builds with proper optimization
  5. Database Schema - Complete Prisma model with all business entities
  6. Workspace Management - npm workspaces for efficient dependency management

  ðŸš€ Ready to Use:

  The project is now ready for development! You can:

  1. Start development: docker compose up --build
  2. Install dependencies: npm install
  3. Type check: npm run type-check
  4. Access services:
    - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
    - Backend: http://localhost:4000
    - Database: localhost:5432
    - Redis: localhost:6379

  The monorepo structure ensures type safety, prevents code duplication, and enables efficient development across the full stack with proper Docker containerization for
  deployment.
