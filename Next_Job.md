## 📝 Notes

### Critical Path Items
1. **Availability Engine** - This is the core feature that blocks everything else
2. **Authentication** - Required for all protected features
3. **Public Booking** - Core business value proposition

### Dependencies
- Ensure Redis is properly configured before implementing availability caching
- Database migrations must be tested thoroughly before production
- Email service (Resend/Postmark) needs to be configured for notifications

### Risk Mitigation
- Start with a simple availability algorithm, optimize later
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Implement comprehensive logging from the start
- Create fallback mechanisms for external services

## 🔄 Next Session Setup

To continue development:
```bash
# Start the development environment
docker compose up -d

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Run database migrations
docker compose exec backend npm run db:migrate

# Start development servers
npm run dev:frontend  # In one terminal
npm run dev:backend   # In another terminal
```

## 📅 Timeline Estimate
- **Authentication System**: 2-3 days
- **Business Profile & Settings**: 2 days
- **Service Catalog**: 1-2 days
- **Availability Engine**: 3-4 days
- **Public Booking Flow**: 2-3 days
- **Calendar Interface**: 2-3 days

**Total Estimated Time**: 12-18 days for core MVP features
